Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography is a project that enables covert communication by embedding secret data within digital images while maintaining visual quality. It utilizes LSB, DWT, or DCT techniques for data hiding, along with AES/RSA encryption for enhanced security. The project is designed to be robust against steganalysis and supports applications in secure messaging, watermarking, and cybersecurity. Future enhancements include AI-driven steganography, blockchain verification, and quantum-secure embedding for next-gen digital security. 🚀🔐
